options(scientific=T, digits = 3) 
# options(scipen=9, digits = 3) 
# ‘scipen’: integer. A penalty to be applied when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential notation.  Positive values bias towards fixed and negative towards scientific notation: fixed notation will be preferred unless it is more than ‘scipen’ digits wider.
# use scipen=999 to prevent scientific notation at all times

# HW Assignment - Estimation 

This exercise uses the graduate school admissions dataset from the applicants to a higher-ed institute. The dataset is LogRegAdmit.csv.  
The variables in the dataset are:  

* `admit`: 0 or 1 (False or True)
* `gre`: gre score
* `gpa`: grade point average at undergraduate level
* `rank`: the ranking of the applicant's undergraduate institute, 1, 2, 3, or 4


## Grad School Admissions

### Question 1  

**After importing the dataset as Adata, check the structure. Make sure admit and rank are stored as factors, instead of numeric or integers. (Hint: Use as.factor() function or factor() function).**

```{r}
```

### Question 2  
**Construct t-intervals for the gre and gpa data for all applicants at 0.80 level and 0.99 level. **

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...


### Question 3  
**Repeat the same calculation for gre in Question 2 but for admitted (1) and rejected (0) separately. (You can subset them first.) Between the admitted and rejected, does the two intervals overlap at 0.80 level? And at 0.99 level?**

### Question 4   
**Make (box-) plots showing the gre distribution among applicants from different school rankings for the admitted and rejected separately. Please use ggplot for this. The x-variable should be rank, and the y-variable should be gre.**

### Question 5   
**Repeat Question 2 and Question 3 for gpa. Do the two groups have t-intervals overlap at 0.80 level? At 0.99 level?**

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...


### Question 6   
**Repeat Question 4 for gpa. Make (box-) plots showing the gpa distribution among applicants from different school rankings for the admitted and rejected separately. Again, use ggplot.**

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...


### Question 7  
**As EDA from the charts and the t-interval calculations you produced, do you observe any potential effects between gre/gpa/rank on admissions? Explain briefly. **
